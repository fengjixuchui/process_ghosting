Process Ghosting
==========

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/2nabj2ukws4ees0w?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/hasherezade/process-ghosting)

This is my implementation of the technique presented by [Gabriel Landau](https://twitter.com/GabrielLandau):<br/>

![](img/proc_ghost.png)

Characteristics:
-
+ Memory artifacts as in [Process Doppelg√§nging](https://github.com/hasherezade/process_doppelganging)
+ Payload mapped as `MEM_IMAGE` (unnamed: not linked to any file)
+ Sections mapped with original access rights (no `RWX`)
+ Payload connected to PEB as the main module
+ Remote injection supported (but only into a newly created process)
+ Process is created from an unnamed module (`GetProcessImageFileName` returns empty string)

<b>WARNING:</b> <br/>
The 32bit version works on 32bit system only.
